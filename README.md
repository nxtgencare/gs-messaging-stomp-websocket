# nxtgen-stomp-websocket-test-client

Using the spring guide for making stomp websockets, this grabs all of the necessary webjars to serve a static html page that can make a web socket.

It's been repurposed to connect to the websocket we use for Legacy Alert integration so we can do simple testing in nxtgencare/checkin-platform.
